I like to experiment with data Structures and Algorithems to see how I can get them to work and see the effect of doing the different Ideas i have.

The Idea behind the structure of these Data Structures is to make a base class and to have the data structures inherit that base cclass as most data structures appear to havea based of storing data in an array.

Initial List of Structures/Containers to make are:
  - BaseStructure
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Max Heap
  - Min Heap
